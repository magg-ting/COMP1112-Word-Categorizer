# Word-Categorizer

## About this repo
This program will read the content of a text file (.txt) and categorize any words therein by their starting alphabetical letter. The program will create new text files named as A.txt, B.txt,... etc. to store each occurrence of words starting with the respective letter. Finally, the program will output how many words there are in each letter file. The output format is similar to the .jpg file included in this repo.

Note: For simplicity, any words that are not fully alphabetical (e.g. "100", "It's", "etc.") will be ignored and not added to the letter files.

## Installation
Install python 3.

## To do
The text file (18887916.txt) has been included to test on the program. You can use other .txt files to test.
